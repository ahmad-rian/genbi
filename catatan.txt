I have the same problem and the solution proved simple:

First, ssh to the server, navigate to your project folder, then delete the symlink from the public folder:

cd public
unlink storage
Finally, run the command to create the symlink manually (assuming we are still in public/):

ln -s ../storage/app/public storage
